# Autonomous Data Ecosystem

A production-inspired autonomous data platform that simulates how modern data teams
(Data Engineering, Analytics, ML) build, monitor, and govern data pipelines at scale.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

- End-to-end batch + streaming ingestion
- Automatic schema detection and drift tracking
- Data quality scoring and rule-based validation
- Feature store with versioned features
- Machine learning pipeline with performance tracking
- SQL-based analytical warehouse
- Pipeline lineage tracking
- Idempotent & backfillable data runs
