# Autonomous Data Ecosystem

A production-style autonomous data platform that simulates real-world data engineering and data science workflows.

This system ingests data, enforces schema and quality contracts, generates analytics, trains ML models, manages a feature store, persists data to a warehouse, and records full pipeline lineage.
